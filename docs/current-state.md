Last reviewed: 2026-09-07

This is the operational ledger for integrated state, blockers and immediate work. Capability history belongs in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md); milestone detail stays in focused workstreams.

## Integration lines

- `dev` is the canonical base/target for ordinary work and Internal Testing candidates.
- `main` is the stable/release line.
- New work starts from the latest green `dev` unless explicitly hotfixed.
- Stable promotions preserve `main` ancestry in `dev` before the next `dev -> main` release cycle, per ADR 0008.
- Repository governance is aligned to `repo-template-sw` `0.11.0` with proportional product-development routing plus the local Android/local-AI/product-UI customizations recorded in `.engineering/baseline.json`.

## Integrated baseline

### Runtime, product and control plane

Harnex has pinned `llama.cpp`, reproducible Android `arm64-v8a` packaging, verified GGUF installation, model/generation lifecycle, cancellation, scheduling, memory-pressure handling, model-aware planning, output constraints and presets. Product support is curated Qwen3.5 dense 0.8B/2B plus the reviewed 4B **4-bit-only** candidate tier; the 4B artifacts remain `CANDIDATE` pending exact-artifact representative-device runtime, memory, thermal and output-quality evidence. Q35-6 still needs representative-device tuning evidence.

`apps/local-llm-phone-test` exposes Overview, Playground, Activity, Applications, Performance, Models, Diagnostics and Settings. Applications control-plane work is complete through ACUX-80 and CPREC-10..70; broader representative-device UX/runtime evidence remains.

### Shared runtime and Consumer boundary

SR-0..5 and repository-side SR-6 tooling are integrated. The public Consumer SDK is now `io.github.daniele21.localllm:consumer-android:0.1.0-alpha.11`; publication from the integrated Harnex candidate completed successfully, including unauthenticated downstream consumption from the public Maven repository.

ADR 0018 is the active production trust boundary for independently distributed consumers. The public Harnex service is explicitly bindable with no custom bind permission so Consumer-before-Host installation cannot permanently block reachability. Reachability is not authorization: authority remains fail-closed Binder UID -> exact installed package -> current signer -> Harnex Control Plane authorization -> enabled use case. Known external consumers are source-observed as `PENDING`; signer replacement becomes `SIGNATURE_CHANGED`; both require explicit user authorization.

Consumer SDK `disconnect()` is part of alpha.11 and supports reversible Settings-owned disconnect/reconnect without weakening Harnex authority. Emulator-only fault/control authority remains separate from production inference authority: the ordinary fault receiver is signature protected and the bounded shell bridge exists only in the Harnex `emulatorE2e` Host process.

### Cross-repository RedactGuard evidence

RedactGuard now consumes immutable Consumer SDK `0.1.0-alpha.11`. Its integrated `dev` baseline is independently signed from Harnex and exposes explicit Connect / Disconnect / Retry behavior in Settings while leaving authorization Harnex-owned.

Exact automated evidence is green for both cross-app paths:

- Consumer-first install -> Host absent -> later Harnex install without RedactGuard reinstall -> `PENDING` -> exact Harnex authorization -> Connect / Disconnect / Reconnect -> replacement signer denied as `SIGNATURE_CHANGED`;
- the complete Two-APK product/lifecycle/fault matrix, including ViewModel/Home continuity and Binder cancellation/process-loss/critical-pressure handling.

The tested Harnex source candidate is tree-equivalent to the integrated Harnex `dev` merge commit. RedactGuard's normal FULL validation also resolves the public alpha.11 artifact rather than relying on a source-candidate override.

Both Harnex and RedactGuard candidates were published successfully to Google Play Internal Testing. The focused physical Play Internal release retest has now been operator-confirmed on the current Play-distributed pair: RedactGuard-first / Harnex-later without reinstall, source-observed `PENDING`, exact Harnex authorization, Connect / Disconnect / Reconnect and representative production Binder/runtime use all behaved as intended. The operator also confirmed the current Play-installed applications use independent signing identities. Exact certificate digest values remain release-evidence metadata and are not duplicated in this operational ledger.

The commits added after the published/runtime-qualified Harnex candidate up to the current release line are limited to documentation, repository governance, verification scripts and workflow-policy surfaces; no Harnex app/runtime source or Android build configuration changed. The focused physical result therefore remains applicable to the current runtime/product tree while deterministic release validation is rerun on the new exact repository HEAD.

### Consumer API, OMBRA, evaluation and audit

CA-0..4 are integrated; RedactGuard remains a pure Consumer SDK client and concrete model/runtime/residency authority stays in Harnex. OMB-6B identity approval, OMB-8 measured quality execution and physical evidence remain open. Model-evaluation work is integrated through EVAL-D-09 with later Android runner/persistence/comparison work continuing.

Local inference Activity/audit is integrated under ADR 0017: accepted inference history uses bounded encrypted app-private storage, verified Binder caller attribution and truthful restart reconciliation; normal telemetry/diagnostics stay content-free.

## Remaining evidence and work gaps

### 1. Representative Android runtime evidence

LAS-07 and remaining CRV/SR/Q35/resource claims require representative physical Android evidence with exact candidate, production JNI/llama.cpp path and compatible GGUF where applicable. The new 4B 4-bit candidate tier is explicitly part of this evidence gap; catalog admission does not certify runtime suitability. Memory, thermal and OEM observations remain distinct from deterministic emulator evidence.

### 2. OMBRA and follow-on work

OMB-6B remains review-gated; OMB-8 must execute reviewed artifact/configuration identities against policy v1. Model evaluation, Q35 device tuning, RAM/thermal evidence and LLUP continue independently where ownership does not conflict.

These broader evidence streams constrain the claims they own but are separate from the focused Play signer/install-order release gate that is now confirmed for the current stable-promotion scope.

## Immediate next block

1. rerun RELEASE/FULL promotion validation on the new exact `dev` HEAD against live `main` after this evidence-ledger update;
2. promote the reconciled green `dev` candidate to stable `main` if exact-head/base validation remains green;
3. continue the independent ARM64/GGUF/runtime/resource/evaluation evidence workstreams without relabeling emulator or focused signer evidence as broader physical proof.
