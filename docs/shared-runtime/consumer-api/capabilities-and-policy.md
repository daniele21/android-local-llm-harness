Canonical scope: shared-runtime.consumer-api.capabilities-policy
Read when: defining capability discovery, defaults, presets, reasoning support or use-case policy
Last reviewed: 2026-08-13

## Goal

Define the host-owned policy and discovery surface that lets a consumer understand and request useful inference behavior without exposing global Harness state, model-management authority or unrestricted runtime tuning.

This document owns what the host advertises and how requests are authorized/resolved. The Kotlin lifecycle belongs to [`public-surface-v1.md`](public-surface-v1.md). The authority boundary is accepted by [ADR 0013](../../adr/0013-public-consumer-capability-boundary.md).

## Policy model

Capability discovery is always scoped by the authenticated caller and explicit use case:

```text
verified package/signing identity
  -> ApplicationId
  -> UseCaseId
  -> host-owned model binding
  -> use-case readiness
  -> allowed/default presets
  -> reasoning/output/session capabilities
  -> limits and defaults
```

The host must not return a global list and expect the client to filter it.

## V1 model authority

The consumer does not choose a model ID in v1.

Harness owns:

```text
ApplicationId + UseCaseId
  -> AppModelBinding / UseCaseProfile
  -> exact curated model profile
  -> exact artifact digest
  -> installed path
  -> effective runtime profile
```

The capability response may include a privacy-safe effective model label/identity when useful for transparency or compatibility, but it is informational rather than a selector. No path, URL, digest-as-load-command, quantization override or alternate model list is exposed.

If a later product requires client-selectable logical models, that authority change requires a successor ADR before implementation.

## Capability response

The response contains only information needed to decide whether the use case can run and to construct a valid request.

### Identity

- `UseCaseId`;
- capability schema/revision identifier;
- optional human-readable use-case label for reference/demo clients.

### Readiness

Readiness is use-case oriented because model choice is host-owned.

Recommended public states:

| State | Consumer meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `READY` | The use case can be prepared under current policy/state. |
| `AVAILABLE_REQUIRES_PREPARATION` | Authorized and expected to become usable through normal host preparation/load. |
| `UNAVAILABLE_MODEL` | The bound curated model/artifact is not currently usable. |
| `UNAVAILABLE_HOST_POLICY` | Temporarily blocked by host/device policy. |
| `INCOMPATIBLE` | Required protocol/capability is unavailable. |

The response may carry a stable machine-readable detail code, but must not leak install paths, download URLs, native states or host-global inventory.

### Effective model information

When approved for the consumer surface, return only a privacy-safe informational projection such as:

- stable display/product identity;
- concise family/size/quantization label when useful;
- readiness already represented at use-case level.

This field must not be accepted back as authority to load or select a model.

### Presets

For each selectable preset:

- `InferencePresetRef` ID/version;
- display label;
- concise semantic description such as latency/quality/determinism intent;
- whether it is the default;
- high-level capabilities affected when relevant.

A use case may expose one default preset and zero alternatives. The entire raw sampling/runtime configuration is never the normal discovery response.

### Reasoning

Advertise the consumer-visible capability, not an implementation guess:

```text
NOT_SUPPORTED
SUPPORTED_NOT_SURFACED
SURFACED_OPTIONAL
SURFACED_REQUIRED_BY_POLICY
```

`SURFACED_REQUIRED_BY_POLICY` is reserved for a concrete future use case. OMBRA PII uses disabled/not-surfaced reasoning.

### Output constraints

Advertise the supported subset of:

- text;
- JSON;
- JSON schema.

Schema length and transport bounds remain host-defined and use-case scoped.

### Session capabilities

Advertise supported session kinds and bounded message/input limits. Context size remains effective host configuration rather than a normal consumer control.

## Preset semantics

A preset is a versioned behavior contract, not a bag of UI defaults.

A preset can internally own:

- sampling parameters;
- context policy;
- output-token budget;
- thinking/reasoning defaults;
- generation guards;
- runtime tuning profile selection.

The exact internal fields may differ by the bound model while preserving the advertised product intent.

Illustrative product semantics:

| Preset | Intent | Typical trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fast` | Minimize latency/resources. | Shorter/lower-cost behavior. |
| `balanced` | Default general-purpose behavior. | Middle ground. |
| `quality` | Favor answer quality. | Higher latency/resource budget. |
| `deterministic` | Stable evaluation/classification behavior. | Less sampling variability. |

Capability discovery is authoritative; these names are not mandatory.

## Preset validation

Preset validity is evaluated against the authenticated application, use case and current host-owned model binding:

```text
verified caller + use case
  -> bound model/profile
  -> allowed preset set
  -> requested/default preset
  -> effective host configuration
```

Rules:

1. omitted preset -> advertised valid default;
2. advertised allowed preset -> resolve exact host configuration;
3. explicit incompatible/not-allowed preset -> typed failure;
4. never silently substitute another preset after explicit selection;
5. never change the model binding to make a requested preset work.

## Default versus recommended

Keep these concepts separate:

- **default** — what Harness uses when the consumer omits a choice;
- **recommended** — an optional UI hint among already allowed choices;
- **available** — what policy and current host state can serve.

A default must be valid whenever the use case is advertised as ready. If no valid default can be resolved, preparation fails explicitly.

## Device-aware policy

Harness may use device capability/tier internally to decide whether the bound model/preset combination is safe or recommended.

The consumer does not reproduce RAM/thermal heuristics. The capability response already reflects host policy.

If conditions change materially, Harness emits a new capability revision or a typed availability change. Existing prepared sessions follow deterministic lifecycle rules rather than silently changing execution identity.

## Reasoning policy

Reasoning support is the intersection of:

```text
bound model capability
AND backend parsing/support
AND use-case policy
AND selected preset/effective mode
AND negotiated protocol feature
```

The consumer must not infer reasoning support from a model label.

An explicit surfaced-reasoning request that cannot be honored fails typed. Harness never exposes hidden/internal reasoning merely because the backend produces it.

## Output policy

Output constraints are use-case scoped.

Examples:

```text
assistant-chat       -> TEXT
transaction-classify -> JSON / JSON_SCHEMA
summary              -> TEXT
document-pii-detection -> JSON_SCHEMA
```

A generic use case does not automatically gain arbitrary JSON-schema execution merely because the backend supports a schema mechanism.

## Limits

Capability discovery may expose stable consumer-relevant bounds such as:

- maximum input characters/messages;
- maximum schema size where supported;
- supported session kinds;
- optional stable output budget categories if introduced later.

Do not expose raw queue size, RAM thresholds, native context allocation or backend batch limits as normal consumer limits.

## Capability revision and caching

The client may cache capabilities only if it can detect staleness.

A stable revision token covers policy-visible changes. A capability response can become stale when:

- host version/policy changes;
- bound-model availability changes;
- app/use-case authorization changes;
- preset/output/reasoning policy changes;
- negotiated protocol features change.

Discovery is advisory, not an authorization token. `prepare` revalidates the caller, use case, revision-sensitive options and current readiness every time.

The client must tolerate `NOT_ALLOWED`, `UNAVAILABLE` or `INCOMPATIBLE` at prepare time after previously successful discovery.

## Host configuration source

Consumer policy is centralized in one host-owned registry rather than scattered across Activities, Binder delegates and UI code.

Conceptually:

```kotlin
ConsumerUseCasePolicy(
    applicationId,
    useCaseId,
    modelBinding,
    readinessPolicy,
    presets,
    defaultPreset,
    reasoningPolicy,
    outputPolicy,
    sessionPolicy,
    limits,
)
```

Existing `AppModelBinding` / resolved use-case configuration must be reused where semantics fit. CA-1 must not create a parallel model-resolution engine.

## Preparation contract

Capability policy is revalidated during preparation:

```text
authenticated caller
  -> resolve authorized use case
  -> resolve current host-owned model binding
  -> validate current readiness
  -> validate requested/default preset
  -> validate reasoning/output/session intent
  -> bind immutable prepared selection
```

An already prepared session does not silently change model or preset when a later capability revision is published.

## Reference-consumer policy

The first product-shaped reference consumer is the OMBRA PDF/PII application defined in [`pii-redactor/`](pii-redactor/). Its initial host policy remains deliberately narrow:

```text
use case: document-pii-detection
model: host-owned reviewed binding (not consumer-selectable)
preset: one deterministic host-owned default, no alternatives
reasoning: disabled / not surfaced
output: JSON_SCHEMA required
session: STATELESS
```

Exact artifact support follows reviewed curated catalog/runtime evidence, not application-side selection.

## Authorization and information minimization

Capability discovery is itself an information surface. Therefore:

- authenticate before returning use-case capabilities;
- reject unauthorized use cases without revealing their configuration;
- return only caller/use-case-scoped readiness and allowed options;
- scrub backend/file/path/download/native/private diagnostic data;
- keep signing/package diagnostics out of ordinary success responses;
- do not expose global or other-client inventory;
- bound discovery requests if needed for service robustness.

## Deterministic tests required by CA-1

- authorized caller receives only its requested authorized use-case capability set;
- different callers cannot enumerate each other's use cases or effective model details;
- omitted preset resolves the valid default;
- allowed preset resolves exact expected host policy without changing model binding;
- unavailable bound model produces use-case readiness/failure without fallback/download;
- unauthorized use case fails before model load;
- incompatible preset fails without substitution;
- unsupported reasoning/output request fails typed;
- stale capability selection is revalidated during prepare;
- capability response contains no path/URL/digest-as-command/native/private diagnostic data;
- no public request type contains a model selector in v1.

## Acceptance criteria

CA-1 is complete when:

- one implementation owns caller/use-case capability policy;
- it reuses existing model/use-case resolution rather than duplicating it;
- readiness semantics are deterministic and consumer-actionable;
- defaults and preset compatibility are explicit;
- reasoning/output support is use-case scoped;
- capability caching/staleness behavior is enforced by prepare-time revalidation;
- unauthorized discovery cannot leak global inventory;
- every optional consumer choice can be validated before native generation starts;
- deterministic tests cover default, unavailable, unauthorized, stale and privacy cases.
