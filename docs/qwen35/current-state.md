This ledger reports only Qwen3.5-only product progress. Repository-wide integrated state remains owned by [`../current-state.md`](../current-state.md).

## Product progress

| ID | Workstream | State | Exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q35-0 | Decision and progressive-disclosure plan | DONE | ADR 0011, target, architecture, roadmap and focused owners agree. |
| Q35-1 | Curated model baseline | DONE | Closed Qwen3.5-only product surface and applicable repository/package validation pass. |
| Q35-2 | Model/backend compatibility | DONE | Exact curated 0.8B/2B Q4_K_M artifacts pass identity, GGUF and pinned-backend smoke validation. |
| Q35-3 | Thinking/template/sampling | DONE | Neutral thinking intent, typed Jinja kwargs, tier-aware profiles and sampler fields resolve end-to-end. |
| Q35-4 | Generation guard | PLANNED | Runaway/repetitive thinking can be interrupted with bounded, typed stop reasons. |
| Q35-5 | Runtime/context/cache capability model | PLANNED | Context and reuse paths do not assume pure KV-cache semantics. |
| Q35-6 | Android runtime tuning | PLANNED | 0.8B and 2B have evidence-backed CPU profiles on representative devices. |
| Q35-7 | Validation suite | PLANNED | Golden/integration/device gates pass for the supported matrix. |
| Q35-8 | Certification | PLANNED | Exact curated artifacts receive evidence-backed certification independently of catalog availability. |

## Completed baseline

### Q35-1

- seven reviewed Qwen3.5 dense 0.8B/2B releases only;
- no consumer manual GGUF import or arbitrary product extension path;
- catalog-anchored binding, persistence and inventory;
- unified Models presentation;
- non-destructive runtime unload separate from model removal;
- user manual smoke validation plus repository/Android/package gates green.

### Q35-2

- pinned llama.cpp revision `aedb2a5e9ca3d4064148bbb919e0ddc0c1b70ab3`;
- exact 0.8B/2B Q4_K_M SHA-256 and size identities;
- trusted GGUF structural fingerprints and fail-closed installer validation;
- privacy-safe compatibility evidence;
- final compatibility run #6 passed exact identity and `load -> tokenize -> minimal generate` for both reference artifacts.

### Q35-3

- neutral `ThinkingMode.ENABLED/DISABLED`;
- typed llama.cpp Jinja `enable_thinking`, with no `/think` or `/nothink` prompt hack;
- end-to-end `minP` and `presencePenalty` plus existing sampler controls;
- versioned tier-aware Fast, Quality, Thinking, Precise and JSON profiles;
- deterministic preset/default/request precedence;
- effective scalar generation telemetry and Room persistence;
- Playground controls plus unit/native/instrumentation coverage;
- `libllama-common.so` explicitly verified in Android packaging.

## Immediate next slice: Q35-4 generation guard

Implement the bounded guard without changing the completed Q35-3 sampling/template contract:

1. define versioned Qwen3.5 guard thresholds and optional thinking budget;
2. implement bounded token-window anomaly detection in `core/runtime-core`;
3. add typed guard stop reasons distinct from cancel/max-token/backend failure;
4. preserve correct streaming cleanup and privacy-safe telemetry;
5. add deterministic guard tests before any device tuning work.

Detailed ownership remains in [`workstreams/generation-thinking.md`](workstreams/generation-thinking.md).

## Remaining evidence gaps

- generation-loop protection remains Q35-4;
- Qwen3.5 hybrid/recurrent context, snapshot and prefix-reuse capability proof remains Q35-5;
- runtime tuning still requires representative Android device evidence;
- certification still requires the Q35-6/Q35-7 physical-device evidence matrix;
- catalog availability is not certification.

## State transition rule

Move a row from `PLANNED` to `IN PROGRESS` only when implementation starts on `dev`. Move it to `DONE` only when its owning acceptance criteria and applicable repository gates pass. Do not use percentage completion.
