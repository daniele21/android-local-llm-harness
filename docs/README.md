## Documentation principles

Harnex uses progressive disclosure and single ownership: **one durable fact has one canonical owner**. The root README explains what Harnex is and provides the shortest usable path; focused documents own the detailed contract.

Machine policy is [`.engineering/documentation-policy.json`](../.engineering/documentation-policy.json). [`documentation-policy.json`](documentation-policy.json) is a compatibility mirror kept byte-identical to the `.engineering` owner by Repository health.

### README ownership

Treat the root README as two semantic owners:

- **README identity** — title, summary, target audience/outcome, stable differentiation and mission. Change only when those claims materially change.
- **README usage** — setup, run, public integration and copy-paste examples. Update whenever current instructions would otherwise become incomplete or misleading.

A normal operational change may therefore report `README_IDENTITY: N/A` and `README_USAGE: UPDATED`.

## Canonical ownership

| Question | Canonical source |
| --- | --- |
| What is Harnex and why should I care? | root README identity sections |
| How do I run/use/integrate Harnex? | root README usage + focused runbooks/API docs |
| Integrated state and blockers | [`current-state.md`](current-state.md) |
| Capability milestones | [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) |
| Repository target | [`implementation-plan.md`](implementation-plan.md) |
| Active bounded work | [`workstreams/`](workstreams/README.md) when needed |
| Durable feature behavior | [`features/`](features/README.md) |
| Architecture and decisions | [`architecture.md`](architecture.md), [`adr/`](adr/) |
| E2E environments/fidelity/residual gaps | [`.engineering/e2e.json`](../.engineering/e2e.json) |
| Merge/release completion | [`definition-of-done.md`](definition-of-done.md), [`releases/harness-0.5.md`](releases/harness-0.5.md) |
| Historical exception material | [`archive/`](archive/) |

## Documentation impact contract

Code and durable documentation ship together. During `preflight-change`, classify the affected documentation surfaces from observable behavior, not filenames:

- `README_IDENTITY`;
- `README_USAGE`;
- `FEATURE_DOCS`;
- `ARCHITECTURE`;
- `ADR`;
- `SECURITY_DATA`;
- `OPERATIONS`;
- `PRODUCT_EXPERIENCE`;
- `CURRENT_STATE`.

Use `UPDATED` or `N/A`. Publication readiness requires `DOCS_CURRENT_WITH_IMPLEMENTATION: PASS`.

Update an existing canonical owner when behavior changes. Create a new document only for durable, non-obvious behavior that is not already discoverable from a public contract, test, architecture owner or focused specification. Do not create documentation merely because a PR or task completed.

E2E target/environment/fidelity changes update `.engineering/e2e.json`; logs, screenshots and reports are bounded evidence rather than new durable documentation owners.

## Document lifecycle

Durable types include roadmaps, target/feature specifications, architecture, ADRs, API references, runbooks/evidence, release/completion policy and design/asset owners. `current-state.md` is the single repository operational ledger.

`workstream-state` is temporary. New repository-level workstreams live under [`workstreams/`](workstreams/README.md). Completed workstreams are deleted by default after durable knowledge is transferred; `archive/` is exception-only. Git history owns normal implementation history.

## Required metadata

Every active non-ADR Markdown document under `docs/` contains:

```text
Status: active
Document type: <supported type>
Owner: <repository or domain>
Canonical scope: <unique dotted scope>
Read when: <specific trigger>
Last reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
```

ADRs keep ADR status/date format. Archived documents use `Status: historical`.

## Reading and writing budgets

CI enforces [`.engineering/documentation-policy.json`](../.engineering/documentation-policy.json): context budgets, reachability, unique canonical scopes, duplicate detection and agent-guide limits. Baselined oversized documents may only shrink.

## Precedence

Executable contracts/tests → accepted ADRs → architecture → focused specifications → target overview → current state → roadmap → README/agent guides → retained history.

When two documents disagree, correct the canonical owner rather than adding another reconciliation layer.

## Validation

```bash
python3 scripts/verify-docs.py --base <target-branch-commit>
python3 scripts/verify_e2e.py
python3 scripts/verify-agent-navigation.py
python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py
git diff --check
```
