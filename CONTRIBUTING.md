# Contributing to Harnex

Thanks for helping improve Harnex. Contributions are welcome across Android integration, runtime correctness, model support, observability/evidence, developer experience, documentation and tests.

If you are not sure where a change belongs, open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/daniele21/harnex/discussions) before investing in a large implementation.

## Good ways to contribute

- fix a reproducible bug or lifecycle edge case;
- improve Android/Consumer SDK developer experience;
- strengthen tests around public contracts, Binder, runtime or model lifecycle;
- add evidence or diagnostics without weakening privacy boundaries;
- improve documentation, examples or troubleshooting;
- improve performance only with comparable evidence;
- help make physical-device support more reproducible and reviewable.

For substantial new capabilities, prefer an issue/discussion first so ownership and evidence requirements are clear.

## Development setup

Prerequisites:

- JDK 17;
- Android SDK API 36;
- Android Build Tools 36.0.0;
- Android NDK 28.2.13676358;
- Python 3;
- Git with submodule support.

Clone and bootstrap:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/daniele21/harnex.git
cd harnex
bash bootstrap-wrapper.sh
```

Use the committed Gradle wrapper for local and CI builds.

Optional environment sanity check:

```bash
java -version
python3 --version
cmake --version
./gradlew --version
```

## Branch model

- `dev` — integration branch;
- `main` — stable/release line;
- contributor branches — use a focused name such as `feature/<scope>`, `fix/<scope>` or `docs/<scope>`.

Keep commits scoped and imperative when practical. Avoid mixing unrelated cleanup into a behavioral change.

## Start with the owning boundary

Harnex intentionally keeps one canonical owner for model/runtime/Binder state. Extend that owner instead of creating parallel policy or state.

Key invariants:

- product/model selection is explicit; no silent model substitution;
- native pointers and `llama.cpp` implementation types stay inside `backends/llama-cpp`;
- runtime core depends on backend-neutral contracts rather than concrete backend policy;
- Binder/public Consumer changes must preserve direct-consumer compatibility;
- prompts and generated output do not enter normal telemetry/logging;
- resources, jobs, sessions and native state must be bounded, cancellable and cleaned on every terminal path;
- emulator evidence never implies physical ARM64/JNI/GGUF, memory, thermal or OEM behavior.

Architecture overview: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). Repository engineering invariants: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Validation

Use the narrowest validation that covers the affected boundary, then let repository CI select stronger gates when risk requires it.

Useful local commands:

```bash
# Formatting
./gradlew spotlessApply

# Repository/static checks
python3 scripts/verify-agent-navigation.py
python3 scripts/verify_architecture.py
./gradlew --no-configuration-cache spotlessCheck detekt verifyNoModelArtifacts

# Full Gradle test surface when appropriate
./gradlew --no-configuration-cache check

# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The repository's canonical command contract is [`.engineering/commands.json`](.engineering/commands.json).

### Validation depth

Repository automation classifies changes by risk rather than using one heavyweight suite for every PR:

- **LEAN** — docs/governance/metadata and cheap repository guards;
- **SCOPED** — contained module change plus direct consumers/tests/lint;
- **STRONG** — public/shared contracts, Binder/control-plane, persistence, native/JNI, packaging or other release-sensitive work;
- **FULL** — promotion/release, global build/CI/toolchain changes or unknown executable scope.

Do not weaken or suppress a legitimate failing gate to obtain a green result.

## Physical-device evidence

Many Harnex claims can be tested automatically; some cannot.

A physical device is required only when the claim depends on real ARM64/JNI/GGUF execution, Android/OEM lifecycle behavior, memory pressure, thermal behavior, Play-delivered identity or other hardware/environment fidelity.

Use:

- [`docs/device-e2e-testing.md`](docs/device-e2e-testing.md) for execution;
- [`docs/device-e2e-evidence.md`](docs/device-e2e-evidence.md) for the privacy-safe evidence contract;
- [`.engineering/e2e.json`](.engineering/e2e.json) for the automated-vs-real-environment boundary.

Never present emulator results as physical-device proof.

## Dependencies

Dependency locking is enabled. When intentionally adding or updating a dependency:

```bash
./gradlew dependencies --write-locks
```

Review the resulting lock changes. Do not introduce dynamic versions such as `latest.release`, `+` or unbounded ranges.

A `llama.cpp` pin change is release-sensitive: review the upstream diff and run the applicable native, Android, model and benchmark evidence before promotion.

## Documentation

Durable behavior and its documentation ship together. Start from [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) to find the canonical owner before creating a new document.

For docs-only changes, prefer improving an existing owner over adding another file. Keep the root README adoption-focused; detailed implementation contracts belong in focused docs.

## Pull requests

A good PR should make the outcome easy to review:

1. explain the observable change and why it matters;
2. keep the diff focused on the owning boundary;
3. identify compatibility, privacy/security, lifecycle or resource risks when applicable;
4. include the tests/evidence that prove the change;
5. update affected durable documentation;
6. leave physical/release-only evidence explicitly pending rather than overstating completion.

Before integration, repository preflight records exact source/base identity and runs the required automated gates. Promotion to `main` requires the release contract, not merely a green unit-test suite.

## Security and sensitive data

Do not commit:

- GGUF/GGML model binaries;
- signing keys, passwords or credentials;
- prompts, generated output or private user documents as test/evidence artifacts;
- private Android paths or sensitive diagnostic exports.
