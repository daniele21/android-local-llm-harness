# Model Evaluation — Coding Agent Guide

This guide owns navigation and validation for model-evaluation implementation under `evaluation/`. Current progress belongs in [`../docs/model-evaluation/current-state.md`](../docs/model-evaluation/current-state.md).

## Read order

1. Read the repository [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
2. Read [`../docs/model-evaluation/README.md`](../docs/model-evaluation/README.md) for capability routing.
3. Read only the focused model-evaluation workstream that owns the change.
4. Read runtime or observability specifications only when the change crosses those existing boundaries.

## Current ownership

`evaluation/contracts` is the only concrete EVAL-1 module. It owns backend-independent dataset, evaluator, sampling, run, identity, compatibility and failure contracts plus deterministic canonical hashing.

Do not create `evaluation/engine`, dataset-store or persistence modules until the corresponding workstream contains real behavior. EVAL-1 intentionally establishes contracts without speculative empty modules.

## Contract invariants

- Depend only on lower-level public contracts required for stable value semantics; never depend on Compose, Room, `llama.cpp` implementation types or app state.
- Dataset, sample-set, evaluator-set, semantic-execution and run identities are immutable and content/configuration-derived.
- Canonical fingerprints use explicit field ordering and exact scalar representation; never depend on map or filesystem iteration order.
- Quality identity excludes the selected model and physical device so supported models can be compared on identical semantic work.
- Runtime compatibility adds device/runtime/tuning/load/warm-up identity without collapsing those dimensions into quality.
- Evaluator specs are declarative and bounded; they cannot name classes, scripts, URLs or executable code.
- Failure contracts use bounded typed codes rather than arbitrary backend exception text.
- Prompt, expected-answer and generated-answer content is not part of persistent run/result contracts.

## Validation

For contract-only iteration run:

```bash
./gradlew :evaluation:contracts:spotlessCheck \
  :evaluation:contracts:testDebugUnitTest \
  :evaluation:contracts:compileDebugKotlin \
  :evaluation:contracts:lintDebug
./gradlew --no-configuration-cache detekt verifyNoModelArtifacts
```

Because adding or changing the module list affects repository navigation and build configuration, also run the repository documentation/navigation guards and the applicable repository-wide gate before merge.
